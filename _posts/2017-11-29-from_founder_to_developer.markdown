#  Why I'm climbing "down" the ladder



My drive to be an entrepreneaur runs deep in my veins. I can remember being 7 and convincing my dad to lend me money to buy newspapers so that I could take my radio flyer wagon and go door to door to our neighbors offering them at inflated prices with homemade muffins as an upcharge. When I finished my masters degree and saw all my friends taking jobs as bottom of the barrel art interns, I felt our communal frustration (I want to be creative! When I chose art I didn't know it meant being a slave to the corporate world and never earning a living wage - quick girls find a husband!). 

So I packed up my car and drove cross country to San Francisco, rented out a live-work loft in a sketchy part of town...and decided if no one was handing out idealistic positions to recent grads that I was going to create my dream job myself. Tech quickly seeped into my lexicon (as im pretty sure it's in the water there) and just like that my startup was born. 

The concept was simple. Siri move over, no one likes talking to robots. how about AI and a real human best friend become one? And instead of downloading an app lets just text her, like a real contact in your phone....ooh! and what if she knew about all the best stuff going on in your city? and she would remember all your likes and dislikes and be able to tell you exactly where to get the best bahn mi sandwich at 2 am....without ever having to read another yelp review. Awesome. 

The concept was simple. The real life journey was not. I spent four years making slide decks, pitching to investors, teaching myself marketing and networking, working odd jobs to pay developers, sleeping on couches, so I could make a living off Airbnbing my own apartment while hacking away at my dream. Heck once I literally purchased a chair cushion from kmart so that I could sleep on it under the stars only to return it the next morning....all as part of a massive goal to have an "accidental run-in" with a potential investor out in the hamptons....and even if your sucessing at life who can afford a hotel out there mid summer?

At the point of no return, when I'd literally sold my closet and moved back in with my parents, something awesome happened. Product Hunt heard about my company and LOVED IT! Overnight Business Insider, Tech Crunch, Bloomberg, Fast Company and Forbes were all writing articles about us. Seed investment followed and before you knew it we had 4 employees. Then a call came about doing a live Today Show interview....and everything came crashing down. My co founder had a complete mental breakdown, and I dont mean an anxiety attack. I mean his underlying family history of schizophrenia came bubbling to the surface and paranoia took hold of our company like a relentless scorned lover. All of the sudden we had to fire our employees because they couldnt be trusted, and our computers were under scrutiny for being hacked. and lastly me. His psychotic episode finished in a violent, bloody and horrifying trauma aimed at me. He ended up in the hospital for three weeks. He wasnt ready to admit the possibility of illness, nor willing to hand me the reigns even without his equity stake changing. 

So I made the hardest decision of my life to roll our company up. It had become an unhealthy obsession for him and for all my dreams of IPO's I couldnt justify risking his or my life for that goal. 
Afterwards I was left with the realty that aside from startup business founder, I didnt exactly have anything concrete to put on my resume. And I started to look around and see those friends, the ones who had started at the bottom of the ladder, actually had pretty impressive jobs now. I've thought long and hard about my love for being an entrepreneur vs. the real life pressures and sacrifices it comes with. I am not saying that I never want to sit in the big chair again, but I do know that if I had the skills of developer that seat would be a lot easier to fill. Somewhere along the way I've started to appreciate all the things the young me wouldnt settle for, health insurance. a reliable paycheck. a job with concrete upward mobility. Maybe the job of developer is a sound choice, that still has creativity at its core, and maybe I'm ending up exactly where I'm meant to be.
