Last week my confidence was through the roof,  I hit my highest ever lessons in a day and procedural ruby was finally clicking! Then OO came, and it has slowed my run to a crawl. It's hard when this happens for me to not immediately get down on myself about not hitting my goals. My motivation is tightly bound by laying out my week and building myself small steps of the mountain to climb daily. I've found in my short life of coding that anytime theres a change to how something can be done - my brain struggles to morph. "but! but! I already know how to call in a name and make it changeable in methods I am comfortable with:
why do I need to do it in a new and confusing way?"

attr_reader, attr_writer and attr_accessor were really throwing me for a loop. 

I think I have begun to understand why. Avi always talks about metaphors. And I realized for me it was as simple as that. Previously I never thought about those methods as reading or writing information. I simply had never visualized their functionality that way. So, in taking away a method (or many) and replacing it with attr_accessor. I would feel lost in my code without those methods as reminders for what my code could do...not able to look at the attr_accessor and relate those same actions to it. 

my solution is all about **#comments**. The same way I **#comment** out exactly what a lab needs to do before I write it, I've begun commenting out exactly what new concepts do every single time I use them. The same way that my old comments #this is a class and #this is the end of a class...now seem embarrassingly rudimentary - Im sure that one day my little reminders about what accessors do will too. 

p.s. this simple and straightforward example was useful for me: http://gregelizondo.github.io/2014/01/28/understanding-and-using-attributes-in-classes.html
