I am an extremely visual person. As I have progressed in flatiron school and my journey to learn and love code - all of my best "AHAH!" moments have come from watching videos or seeing it in action. At first I took endless handwritten notes as I worked my way through the lessons. But pretty quickly, I realized there SO much to take in - that even finding an example 100's of pages into a notebook isnt very savvy (especially when google exists). 

Instead, I began making these visual cheat sheets for functions to help me understand them. They are easy references for me to go back to when I start to feel a little lost and really break it down rudimentarily.
