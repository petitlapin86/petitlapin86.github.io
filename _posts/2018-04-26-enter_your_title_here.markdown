Alright Sinatra -time, everybody dance! 

This has been the first project that I can honestly say was enjoyable. I crawled my way through the CLI gem (which now looking back seems so simple!). 
I've approached the second half of this course differently than the first. I have actually been completing sections and circling back to final projects. A lot of my classmates say ("oh my gosh dont you feel totally lost after time has passed?) The answer is - YES. 

But for me, thats a beautiful part of the learning curve, the confidence I gain when I pick something up I haven't learned about or worked on in a month is a really great booster for me to realize just how much I am retaining (and where I need to practice on the areas I'm not). It's also allowed me to get to a point in the course where my job wish list is a little more clear, and I have a better sense of cohesion with my portfolio and my projects and what they each bring to the whole. 

As far as sinatra goes, I love it. MVC and RESTful routes they just click for me. If only I could say the same about REACT......

But hopefully by the time I circle back I'll be struggling my way to loving that too!
